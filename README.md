# Leukemia_Diagnosis
 Leukemia Assessment via End-to-end Deep Learning                         |   
In summary, we have developed an end-to-end deep learning approach,       |
LAED, for leukemia type prediction that is both labor-saving and highly   | ![LOGO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZhangChenLab/LAED/main/README/OIG.png)  
accurate. Our study aims to assist hematologists in the clinical          |
diagnosis of leukemia by facilitating the morphological analysis of       |
marrow smears.
